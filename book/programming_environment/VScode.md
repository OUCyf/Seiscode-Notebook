### Remote-SSH
After configuring the `SSH key`, use `Remote-SSH` plugin.

:::{tip}
If the Shell used by the remote is `Bash`, and the local machine is `Zsh`, you may experience failure to boot VSCode terminal problem. In this case, you need to modify the configuration file of VSCode to restart the terminal correctly.

Open the command panel, input the `Remote-SSH: Settings`, search `terminal.integrated.shell.linux`, and change `/bin/zsh` to `/bin/bash`. Please refer to
[microsoft/vscode-remote-release issues #38](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/38)
